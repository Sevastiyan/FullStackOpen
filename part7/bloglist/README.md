# BlogList

Have you ever wanted a great place to store your bookmarks? Me neither, you already have a bookmark manager on your browser, so why bother with this one? Well if you want to try out something new read on:

With the help of the FullStack Developer course I have developped A fully functional React web app, built with the current standards in web development. It wasnt necessary, but it thought me alot in the field of web development, and now I understand how React apps are made. 

The purpose of the app is to store blog posts off of the internet for some reason. But whats actually interesting is the tech involved in the app. I have learned different libraries that are implemented here such as:


| Library | Details |
| --- | --- | 
| React-Redux | State management | 
| React-Router | Navigation |
| Node.js | Backend |
| Express | Requests |
| MongoDB - Atlas | Database |
| Cypress | E2E Testing |
| MaterialUI | Frontent UI |


## How to use the app

Assuming that Nodejs is preinstalled on the system. If not look at the [following guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)  

Starting the Backend:

1. Clone the library using `git clone` in a terminal with git enabled.
2. Navigate to `./bloglist-backend/` folder and run the following commands:
    - `npm i` will install the dependencies
    - add the `.env` file in the directory with the necessary credentials to connect to **MongoDB - Atlas**.
    - run `npm start` for deployment, or `npm run dev` for debugging.


Starting the Frontend:
2. Navigate to `./bloglist-frontend/` folder and run the following commands:
  a. `npm i` will install the dependencies
  b. `npm start` to start the React app
